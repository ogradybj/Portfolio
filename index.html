            <p>I am a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for designing and creating. I have a Bachelors and Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Dayton. During graduate school I was a contract worker for the Air Force Research Labs at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base where I did research on morphing wing mechanisms. I also spent time working on spherical mechanisms in grad school. <br><br>
            For the past four years I ahve been working as a design engineer for Cummins Inc., working on diesel engines. During my time at Cummins I have worked on geartrain components, castings and housings, valvetrains and camshafts. At Cummins I have been using Analysis Led Design tools throughout the product design procedure and have also performanced a lot of structural analysis, thermal analysis and dynamic analysis.<br><br>
            In addition to the professional work I have done, I also get involved in many engineering projects to learn new skills and expand my engineering knowledge.

<h3>Valvetrain </h3>
<p>At Cummins my primary responsibility is with camshaft design and valvetrain anlaysis</p>


<h3>Geartrain Design</h3>

<h3>Bolted Joint Design</h3>
<p>Correct capscrew number and size as well as assembly procedure is important for ensuring the integrity of fastened components. During my time at Cummins I utilized many tools to design and analysis bolted joint systems.

For issues found in systems where the simplified calculations are not sufficient a more detailed bolted joint analysis was performed using Ansys and the forces and moments acting on the capscrews in a system. All of the work done both calculations and further analysis are based on the bolted joint standard VDI-2230.</p>

<h3>Failure Analysis</h3>
<p>During testing when a component fails the approach taken to analysis the failure is a physics based approach that steps through a fault tree of possible failure modes and based on measurements, testing or analysis aims to define the root cause and propose solutions.</p>
<br><br>
<p>In the example shown the system being tested was a geartrain accessory drive with a hydraulic pump attached directly to the housing. The mass of the pump puts a bending moment on the gear housing and also changes the natural frequency of the system. The physics based approach to root cause investigation starts by defining the problem and splitting up the cause with the system having higher loading than it was designed for, or having insufficient strength. In this case the latter item leads you to investigate the material properties of the failed component as well as look at the crack initiation and propogation. Then investigating if the system was loaded higher than what it was designed for leads into looking </p>



<h3>Casting Design</h3>
<p>As part of severel projects I have worked on castings</p>

<h3>Thermal Analysis</h3>

<p>In many instances design changes can lead to certain components having a higher heat input than they were designed for. On a heat shield project I needed to figure out if moving the turbocharger position would cause thermal issues on a composite part. Through setting up a thermal analysis model I was able to define the severity of the increase in temperature and also propose options for the types of heat shields that would allow the component to survive.</p>

<h2>Graduate Thesis</h2>

<h3>Thesis Summary</h3>
<p>During graduate school my thesis work consisted of morphin wing mechanisms research. The model used was a simplified morphing wing mechanism that allows the swing angle and the chord length to be adjusted. As the wing is continually made lighter and lighter the assumption is that the flexibility of the system will increase. The research aimed to investigate the optimal actuator placement with increased flexibility. Both a dynamic simulation modle and experimental test setup was used for the research. The test setup was designed in solidworks and built with LabView to control the test setup and integrate all fo the sensors. A DOE was run with the setup and the results used to calibrate the computer simulation model.</p>

<br><br>
<h3>Test Rig</h3>
<p>The test setup consisted of the wind mechanism with disctrete connection points for the actuator placement and flexible spars. The test setup was actuated by pneumatic cylinders that were supplied air by pressure regulators controlled by LabView. LabView was also used for all of the sensor integration. The sensors included and LVDT to measure the stroke of the pnuematic cylinders, in-line load cells to measure the force applied and a potentiometer used as a rotary encoder to measure the angular position of the wing mechanism.</p>

<br><br>
<h3>Computer Model</h3>
<p>MSC adams was used for the dynamic simulation of the wing mechanism, initially a model of the wind was built then the model was parameterized and MATLAB/Simulink was used to update the model based on parameter changes as well as execute the model as part of a larger optimization script. Since the main research topic was investigating actuator placement as flexibility changes, NASTRAN was also used to iterate through changes in link flexibility to input the modal frequencies into the ADAMS model.</p>

<h2>Electronics Projects</h2>


<h3>Circuit Design</h3>
<p>As part of a laser distance sensor project, I designed the circuit for the CMOS line-scan sensor</p>

<h3>Hobby Robotics</h3>
<p>Both electronics and computer science have always been an interest of mine. Hobby robotics projects have helped me learn more about electronics, microcontrollers, motor control and computer science concepts.</p>
<p>For the two wheeled robot I used a raspberry pi to provide the brains of controlling the robot and an arduino to control the motors and distance sensors, with serial communication between the two.</p>
