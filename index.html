      <p class="detail">My name is <a href="http://www.ogradybj.com/files/BrendanOGrady.pdf">Brendan O'Grady</a> and I am a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for designing and creating. I have a Bachelors and Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Dayton. During graduate school I was a contract worker for the Air Force Research Labs at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base where I did research on morphing wing mechanisms. I also spent time working on spherical mechanisms in grad school. <br><br>
            For the past four years I have been working as a design engineer for Cummins Inc., working on diesel engines. During my time at Cummins I have worked on geartrain components, castings and housings, valvetrains and camshafts. At Cummins I have been using Analysis Led Design tools throughout the product design procedure and have also performed a lot of structural analysis, thermal analysis and dynamic analysis.<br><br>
            In addition to the professional work I have done, I also get involved in many engineering projects to learn new skills and expand my engineering knowledge. These areas unclude composites work, electronics and computer science.

<h3>Valvetrain Work</h3>

<p class="detail">Valvetrain work includes cam design, working with GT Suite to do dynamic analysis. Responsible for running a valvetrain test rig, analyzing data using Matlab and using results to correlate dynamic model.</p>

<h3>Bolted Joint Design and Analysis</h3>

<p class="detail">Correct capscrew number and size as well as assembly procedure is important for ensuring the integrity of fastened components. For issues found in systems where the simplified calculations are not sufficient a more detailed bolted joint analysis is performed using Ansys and the forces and moments acting on the capscrews in a system. All of the work done both calculations and further analysis are based on the bolted joint standard VDI-2230.</p>

<h3>Failure Analysis</h3>

<p class="detail">During system testing a failure showed up. Using a failure analysis process narrowed down likely cause and proved based on vibration data and modal analysis to show that system was being excited and with a simple support failure mode was eliminated.</p>

<img  id="ghpic" src="pics2/ghcrackpic.jpg">
<!--
<p>In the example shown the system being tested was a geartrain accessory drive with a hydraulic pump attached directly to the housing. The mass of the pump puts a bending moment on the gear housing and also changes the natural frequency of the system. The physics based approach to root cause investigation starts by defining the problem and splitting up the cause with the system having higher loading than it was designed for, or having insufficient strength. In this case the latter item leads you to investigate the material properties of the failed component as well as look at the crack initiation and propogation. Then investigating if the system was loaded higher than what it was designed for leads into looking. It was found that the natural frequency of the pump system was excited by engine firing. The analysis correlated well with actual vibration test data.</p>

<h2>Graduate Thesis</h2>
<!--
<h3>Thesis Summary</h3>

<p>During graduate school my thesis work consisted of morphin wing mechanisms research. The model used was a simplified morphing wing mechanism that allows the swing angle and the chord length to be adjusted. As the wing is continually made lighter and lighter the assumption is that the flexibility of the system will increase. The research aimed to investigate the optimal actuator placement with increased flexibility. Both a dynamic simulation modle and experimental test setup was used for the research. The test setup was designed in solidworks and built with LabView to control the test setup and integrate all fo the sensors. A DOE was run with the setup and the results used to calibrate the computer simulation model.</p>

<br>
<h3>Test Rig</h3>

<p class="detail">The test setup consisted of the wing mechanism with disctrete connection points for the actuator placement and flexible spars. The test setup was actuated by pneumatic cylinders that were supplied air by pressure regulators controlled by LabView. LabView was also used for all of the sensor integration. The sensors included and LVDT to measure the stroke of the pnuematic cylinders, in-line load cells to measure the force applied and a potentiometer used as a rotary encoder to measure the angular position of the wing mechanism.</p>

            <br><br>
            <h3>Computer Model</h3>

<p class="detail">MSC adams was used for the dynamic simulation of the wing mechanism, initially a model of the wing was built then the model was parameterized and MATLAB/Simulink was used to update the model based on parameter changes as well as execute the model as part of a larger optimization script. Since the main research topic was investigating actuator placement as flexibility changes, NASTRAN was also used to iterate through changes in link flexibility to input the modal frequencies into the ADAMS model.</p>

<h3>Circuit Design</h3>

<p class="detail">As part of a laser distance sensor project, designed the break out board circuit for the CMOS line-scan sensor. The board schematic was designed made in EaglePCB software as well as the board routing. The challenge was to create as small of a footprint as possible.</p>

            <h3>Hobby Robotics</h3>
           <p class="detail">Both electronics and computer science have always been an interest of mine. Hobby robotics projects have helped me learn more about electronics, microcontrollers, motor control and computer science concepts. For the two wheeled robot a raspberry pi was used to provide the brains of controlling the robot and an arduino to control the motors and distance sensors, with serial communication between the two.</p>
